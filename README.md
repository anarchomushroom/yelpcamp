**YelpCamp**

This is my github repository for the capstone project in Colt Steele's Udemy Course, "The Web Development Bootcamp". This site is a Yelp style application where users can add different campgrounds around the world to the site. Users can then edit and delete campgrounds, leave comments, and also edit and delete those comments.

To build this application I used the following technologies and packages:

* HTML and CSS

* NodeJS

* Express

* Embedded Javascript

* PassportJS

* MongoDB

* Mongoose

* Connect-Flash

**Planned Features**

Obviously, the application is not yet complete, and I have a few features that I want to add in to further develop my skills. In rough order of priority, these features are:

* Improve the styling

* Email based authentication

* Password resets

* Google Maps integration

* A "Recently Added" section to the homepage

* Authentication using Google/Twitter/Facebook

**Takeaways from this Project**

Having completed the project, I feel confident in my abilities as a web developer, however I know I have a lot more to learn. EJS, while handy to learn, I did not enjoy using and my plan is to learn something like React or Vue for rendering the client side. It is obviously a large task to try and migrate the application over to React from EJS, but later on in my career it might be a fun challenge to revisit. I know that I need to get more experience with RESTful routing, so I want to build more apps and APIs using Express, and I think my knowledge on Mongo and the Mongoose package could use some work.
